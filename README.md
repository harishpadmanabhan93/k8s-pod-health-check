Subject: Automated Kubernetes Pod Health Check & Issue Summarization

Overview:

This automation is designed to proactively monitor the health of all pods running in a Kubernetes cluster. Its primary goal is to identify pods that are not in a "Running" state, analyze the reasons for their failure, and provide actionable summaries and suggested fixes using OpenAI’s advanced language model. The results are compiled into a comprehensive report for easy review and troubleshooting.

What Problem Does It Solve?

Manual Pod Monitoring is Inefficient: In large or dynamic Kubernetes environments, manually checking the status of every pod is time-consuming and error-prone.
Root Cause Analysis is Complex: When pods crash or fail to start, the reasons are often buried in Kubernetes events and logs, requiring expertise and significant time to interpret.
Delayed Remediation: Without timely and clear insights, issues can persist longer, impacting application reliability and user experience.
This automation solves these problems by:

Continuously scanning all pods for issues.
Automatically collecting relevant events and logs for problematic pods.
Using AI to summarize the root cause and suggest possible fixes.
Generating a report for quick action by DevOps or engineering teams.
How Does It Work?

Connects to the Kubernetes API:
The script authenticates using a Bearer token and connects to the cluster’s API server. It is compatible with clusters using self-signed certificates (e.g., Minikube).

Fetches All Pods:
It retrieves the status of every pod across all namespaces.

Identifies Problematic Pods:
Any pod not in the “Running” phase is flagged for further analysis.

Collects Events and Logs:
For each problematic pod, the script fetches:

Kubernetes events related to the pod (e.g., scheduling failures, image pull errors).
Pod logs (if available), which may contain application-level errors.
AI-Powered Summarization:
The script sends the collected data to OpenAI’s GPT model, which:

Summarizes the likely cause of the issue.
Suggests possible remediation steps.
Report Generation:
All findings are compiled into a JSON report (
problematic_pods_report.json
), including:

Pod name, namespace, status, reason, message, events, logs, and AI-generated summary.
Error Handling:
The script logs all errors and exits gracefully if required environment variables are missing or if API calls fail.

Benefits:

Saves Time: Automates routine health checks and root cause analysis.
Improves Reliability: Enables faster detection and resolution of pod issues.
Leverages AI: Provides expert-level insights and suggestions, even for less experienced operators.
Easy Integration: Can be scheduled or run on-demand; works with any Kubernetes cluster accessible via API.
Requirements:

Access to the Kubernetes API server (URL and Bearer token).
OpenAI API key for AI summarization.
Node.js 22.x environment (no external dependencies required except built-in
fs
).
How to Use:

Set the following environment variables:

KUBE_API_SERVER
: URL of your Kubernetes API server.
KUBE_TOKEN
: Bearer token for authentication.
OPENAI_API_KEY
: Your OpenAI API key.
Run the script in a Node.js 22.x environment.
